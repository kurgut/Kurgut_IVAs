# Kurgut_IVA

This is a "collection" of IVAs I made for KSP, for video projects mostly.
I'm making a public repo for all of those, because I've been asked quite often if I'd release them, and to make everyone enjoy them.

# Important Note : 
Most of those IVAs have been made quite a while ago, so expect bugs, non-working features, etc. As they were made for singular projects, they will likely not receive any further updates, or fixes.
As of this, I also wont provide any support for this. Consider this as a "dump" repo ^^
You can pick dependencies depending of what IVA you want (detailled below)
Enjoy !
